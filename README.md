# warmhole-detection-project
A software idetifying all the warmholes in a particular network

designed a python script, which generates a random WSN on a 2D plane to simulate sensor nodes
deployed in an area.
A comprehensive solution for
identifying and mitigating wormhole attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks. Utilized spanning
trees and Euclidean distance analysis, the system effectively detects potential security threats
and provides valuable insights into the network topology.

The project contains a .py file,
run it on your VM, and make changes as per your requirements.
Attaching a detailed report as well.
